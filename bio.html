    <p1>
      Like I said earlier, ceramics is a passion of mine, but I have recently taken a liking to web design.
      I am currently enrolled in university pursuing my BFA and plan to take web design classes not too long after I graduate
      so that I can make a career out of it. My education is very important to me, so I am not currently accepting commissions of any sort. 
      Because of that, I will not bother providing contact information, but I hope you enjoy the website!
